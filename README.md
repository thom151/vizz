# Vizz - Visualizing Your Stories

##  ðŸ“– Description
**Vizz** is an interactive website that would transform stories into images. By uploading a story or a book, users will be generated images per chapter as they read.

## ðŸ¤” Why Vizz?
I love reading books. Reading books requires a lot of imagination. However, I often find it challenging to visualize intricate plots or alien worlds, especally reading science fiction books. Viz was created to bridge the gap between imaging and storytelling, offering readers a way to see the stories come to life.

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=libsql://vizz-db-...  # Your Turso database connection
   PLATFORM=dev                       # Set to 'dev' for local development
   SECRET=XcjOa...                    # Secret key for tokens
   PORT=8080                          # Port the server will run on
   OPEN_API=sk-Hgtk...                # OpenAI API key
