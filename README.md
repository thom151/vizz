# Vizz - Visualizing Your Stories

##  üìñ Description
**Vizz** is an interactive website that would transform stories into images. By uploading a story or a book, users will be generated images per chapter as they read.

## ü§î Why Vizz?
I have recently been reading a lot of science-fiction books. Reading books requires a lot of imagination. However, I often find it challenging to visualize intricate plots or alien worlds, especally reading science fiction books. Viz was created to bridge the gap between imaging and storytelling, offering readers a way to see the stories come to life.

## üöÄ Quick Start
Follow these steps to set up and run Viz on your local machine.
Before starting, ensure you have:
1. [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your machine.
2. A `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables configured:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=libsql://vizz-db-...  # Your Turso database connection
   PLATFORM=dev                       # Set to 'dev' for local development
   SECRET=XcjOa...                    # Secret key for tokens
   PORT=8080                          # Port the server will run on
   OPEN_API=sk-Hgtk...                # OpenAI API key
   ASSISTANT=asst_gA4...              # Assistant functionality (optional)
   ```

### How to Obtain Environment Variables
1. **DATABASE_URL**
   - Create a Turso database account at [https://turso.tech](https://turso.tech) and set up a new database.
   - Click create group and then click aws.
   - Click continue with AWS.
   - Enter a name, select a region and then click `Create Group`.
   - Click the database url to copy. It should look like `dbName-username.aws-us-east-1.turso.io`.
   - On the right side, click the three dots again and click `Create Token`.
   - Lastly, copy your database url and connect it with `?authToken={your newly created token}`.
  
2. **SECRET**
   - Generate a secret key by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -base64 64
     ```
   - Copy the output and paste it into your `.env` file as the `SECRET` value.

3. **OPEN_API**
   - Sign up for an OpenAI account at [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
   - Go to the API Keys section in your OpenAI dashboard and generate a new API key.
   - Copy the key and paste it into your `.env` file as the `OPEN_API` value.
   - **Note**: Using the OpenAI API for image generation will incur costs. Allocate a budget of around $1‚Äì$2 to cover the API usage fees, depending on the number of images generated.

4. **ASSISTANT**
